            In total 6566 m stone bunds and 100 percolation ponds have been
            constructed in 2022. These walls are not meant to lock people out,
            but to keep fertile soil inside the forest. The captured soft
            sediment provides water and nutrients to the young plants. It
            stimulates the growth of seedlings and natural regeneration. Our
            little plants had a survival rate of over 90% last year, an internal

          <h1>Water reservoirs</h1>
          <h2>EthioTrees</h2>
          <p>
            As elsewhere in the world, men and women in Tigray often have
            different priorities for the future of their village. When designing
            “plan vivo maps” with women-only groups, it became clear that women
            generally wanted to invest most in drinking water infrastructure.
            This is no big surprise, since fetching water is a burden falling
            hardest on women. In Adi Lehsti, Meam Atali, and Gidmi Gestet,
            fetching water during the dry season required a walk of 4 hours per
            day. The opening of 3 new water reservoirs, paid using PVCs, has
            reduced that time consumption a sixfold.
